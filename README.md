Description
Our project creates a website that has a streamlined version of UMD financial services on one website. This will make viewing your transactions and payment easier for students at the university. We used HTML, JAVA, CSS, and SQL to make a website that allows users to input login information and see their transactions and payments to The University of Maryland.
